# SAS_DDE_VBA
Psychometrics Enrichment talk 2019
This repo stores the psychometrics enrichment talk I gave internally in the 2019. 
It introduced an automatic way to generate tab template in excel sheet and 
use SAS DDE approach to populate table from SAS to excel without touching the format setup.
